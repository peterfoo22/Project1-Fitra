Super Hi Shopify Theme Development Project


4/15/2020-I learned about the different built in objects you can call throughout the code that are built in and readers and what they the different objects have inside them.  There are quite a few different readers in each object so Iâ€™ve been using the Shopify docs to go through them and getting a better understanding of what you can do with the objects.  Mostly used the product objects and variant objects and used the for loops to spit out the different code and images in each and knowing what readers to use.

4/16/2020-  Learned about using logical statements in liquid, the control flow tags and the iteration tags. Also learned about using different filters for the objects and looking up the reference guide to that.

 4/17/2020- Using Locale files for translation, and JSON notation for this file.  Created an Add to cart form using the basic template from the cart.liquid form and adjusting that to use for my landing page.
